# Linguistic and Cultural Heritage Ontologies

Several ontologies relate to the project at hand, but none of them are fully
adequate. They should be used to make it more interoperable for existing
projects, and as a source of inspiration. 

## Cultural Heritage 

CIDOC-CRM

## Linguistics 

GOLD

## Text Format 

TEI? But do I need to be that specific? 
Also TEI is very much an xml schema, I am not sure it would be great to build
this all in RDF, on the other hand, it would be very nice to be able to auto
generate a TEI document directly from the graph. 

## Bibliographic Data

BibFrame 

## Taxonomy of Topics 

FAST? Look at parsing the LCSH? and building from that?
